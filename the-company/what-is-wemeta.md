# What is WeMeta?

## Our Vision

We're glad you asked! WeMeta was born in early 2021 out of a need to make the Metaverse **more accessible, more useful, and more exciting for users all across the world**. We saw that users were trying to join the Metaverse - but hitting all kinds of obstacles. The price of Land was unclear, it was difficult to know the location of the Land being bought, and in many cases - folks were purchasing land without even seeing photos! At WeMeta, we've decided to change all that.

WeMeta is the go-to platform for all things Metaverse. From [Community Leaderboards](https://www.wemeta.world/leaderboards), to [Activity Feeds](https://www.wemeta.world), to [buying, selling, and trading digital land](https://www.wemeta.world/browse) - our robust data insights and accessible UI makes it easier than ever to interface with the Metaverse.

What's more - WeMeta is just getting started. We are constantly releasing new features and tools to address the growing needs of our users amidst the booming Metaverse, and we can't wait to see what the future holds.

## Our Values

We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

### Trust

WeMeta is built on trust, and that shines across our product verticals. From the data we surface, to the Metaverses we support, to our personal team culture - shared trust is first of mind for all us and all of our customers.

### Honesty

There can't be trust without honesty. At WeMeta we strive to be honest above all else - be that in the data we present, the partnerships we make, or with our communications both inside and outside of the team.

### Data First

There is a sea of noise out there and WeMeta aims to be a beacon of truth. We will always search for and surface data in an honest, transparent manner.
