# Digital Land

Digital Land is to the Metaverse what static web pages were to the original internet. Many worlds across the Metaverse allow users and communities to purchase digital real estate—the 'stuff' that makes up the digital environment users interact with within the Metaverse. Much like the physical world, **once digital real estate is purchased, the owner of that real estate has the ability to 'digitally' build (program) on top of it**. Given the near infinite applications of the Metaverse, builders can build a whole host of experiences; be it an [art gallery](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels?q=gallery), a [casino](https://decentra.news/decentraland-casino-is-hiring/), a [mystery hunt](https://thewonderquest.com/home), or a [high-fashion store.](https://apnews.com/article/gucci-roblox-76339d10f139e9b0d39761bd8426c11e)

As with the real world, **not all plots of land are equal**. Some are located near more desirable areas of the Metaverse; whether that’s due to [actual game mechanics](https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/gameplay/land), [proximity to other interesting areas of the Metaverse](https://somniumtimes.com/2021/04/23/the-great-immersive-strides-of-somnium-space-mesmerized-by-water/), or even [your 'neighborhood' and its underlying community](https://nftevening.com/gutter-city-is-the-first-nft-town-in-the-sandbox-metaverse/). This presents a vibrant and exciting land-trading marketplace (hosted here on WeMeta!) for users to engage in.
