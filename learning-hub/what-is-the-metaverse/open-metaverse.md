# Open Metaverse

The Open Metaverse is **one which tends to leverage more decentralized systems of operation**. For instance, Open Metaverses may sell Land (NFTs) or handle its transactions on the Blockchain, or otherwise be controlled & jointly owned by the community. Decentraland, Sandbox, Somnium Space, and Cryptovoxels are all examples of Open Metaverses.

The Open Metaverse is exciting because it provides innate mechanisms and incentives for players to create their own economies, communities, and sub-worlds within the Metaverseâ€”while also enabling equitable compensation for those investments.
