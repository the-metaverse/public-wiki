# NFTs

An NFT is a [Non-Fungible Token](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211). Simply put, it is **a cryptographically verifiable way of uniquely defining a digital item and its ownership**. Unlike cryptocurrencies, NFTs cannot be traded or exchanged for other NFTs at equivalency. If you [mint](https://help.foundation.app/en/articles/4742869-a-complete-guide-to-minting-an-nft) (create), receive or purchase an NFT on a blockchain, there is a secure, tamper-proof ownership record of your possession of that NFT.

Much of the next generation of the web, including the Metaverse, rely on NFTs to establish ownership of digital assets. **In the case of the Open Metaverse, each parcel of Land (digital real estate) is an NFT**.&#x20;

NFT communities are often defined by possession of certain community Tokens, for instance, [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), the [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/), and [CrypToadz](https://cryptoadz.io). Some NFTs have even created entire [play-to-earn economies](https://pinayteenvestor.com/axie-infinity-philippines/) - ['Axies'](https://axieinfinity.com) like the one below, have a market cap of over a billion dollars!
