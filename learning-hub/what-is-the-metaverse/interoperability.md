# Interoperability

Interoperability is **the ability for systems to exchange and make use of information**. A simple real-world example might be a computer mouse. Typically a computer mouse can be plugged into different computers, regardless of operating system, and work immediately; thus, a computer mouse is said to be interoperable.

**In the Metaverse, interoperability refers to the ease with which information can be carried and exchanged across worlds and across protocols**. For instance, owning an item in one world (e.g. Decentraland) and being able to use it or view it in another world (e.g. Sandbox). Or, having currency in one world (e.g. Somnium Space) and being able to spend it in another world (e.g. Cryptovoxels). Of course, because these items are innately digital, the form these items could take across Metaverses could also be changed. For instance, your car in one world could turn into a sword in another, or a poster somewhere else.

**Metaverse interoperability doesn’t come for free** (from an engineering standpoint) and requires the conscious **buy-in of either the game designers** behind each world—or the **assistance of ‘bridges**’—a third-party entity that links data across different worlds.

There are several examples of interoperability already—from the [MetaKey](https://themetakey.com), to the MetaPortal, to currencies across [Ethereum ](https://ethereum.org)and [Solana](https://solana.com). But the space is new, and we’re bound to see many more, very soon.
