# Play-to-Earn

**Play-to-earn games allow users to farm & collect cryptocurrency and NFTs which may be sold or trade on the market**. By regularly playing the game, players can earn more items & tokens to sell and generate income. In some regions, **players have even begun to replace or supplement their salaries by playing these games** - for instance, [Axie Infinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg5C2EbYueo) in South-East Asia. However, as these games grow more financially lucrative, the financial barrier for entry may increase - or, the rewards for playing the game may decrease as more players try to join.

Nonetheless, play-to-earn games are an exciting application of in-Metaverse player economies and are providing **a compelling avenue for economic opportunity in a new, and growing space**. Many of these economies can be created without the explicit design of the Metaverse creators. For instance, in Somnium Space [we are already seeing player-run communities](https://somniumtimes.com/2021/10/04/welcome-to-hotz-house-a-platform-for-artists-to-truly-own-and-monetize-their-creations/) who gate events with community NFTs, pay builders with a blockchain-based community currency, and reward community members and ecosystem participants with these same currencies and NFTs.
