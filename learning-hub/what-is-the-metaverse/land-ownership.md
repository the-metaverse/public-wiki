# Land Ownership

In the Open Metaverse, ownership of Metaverse assets are typically expressed in NFTs. Metaverse designers will establish how much of their Metaverse, and which aspects of it, are up for sale. They will cryptographically assign these components to NFTs (minting) and then place them for sale on platforms [like WeMeta](https://wemeta.world/browse). **Since these components are NFTs, they may be freely traded and speculated on by users all across the world**—so long as those users have an internet connection and the blockchain on which the NFTs are minted remains available.

In the Closed Metaverse, ownership of assets is also expressed through tables; however, those tables are less transparent, and typically **trading of Closed Metaverse assets is restricted exclusively to systems that are approved, or that exist within the walled garden** of that Metaverse. In another sense, Closed Metaverses have _custody_ of your assets (much like a bank has custody of your money), meaning that the operators of the Closed Metaverse can choose to control or restrict your access to those assets.

Open Metaverses too may exert this level of control, though many Open Metaverse games themselves run on the blockchain—preventing this kind of interference.
