# Digital Wallets

A digital—or blockchain—wallet allows users to store and manage their Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies & NFTs. When transactions on the blockchain occur, they often occur between (e.g. to and from) digital wallets (addresses). As the blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions in and out of these wallets, wallet owners can be said to directly own their own currency; versus a bank which holds that currency in custody.

This is a massive plus for ownership and censorship-resistance, however, this does add a heavy burden to users who need to guard their wallets very closely. If a user loses access to their wallet or forgets the password, there is no central authority that can assist in its recovery.

Common digital wallets include [Metamask](https://metamask.io), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com). Users can also store their currencies on a physical blockchain wallet such as [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com).
