# Closed Metaverse

A closed Metaverse is **one which tends to leverage more centralized systems of operation**. For instance, a closed Metaverse may not handle its Land or transactions on the Blockchain. Meta, Fortnite, and Roblox are all examples of Closed Metaverses.

Closed Metaverses have historically benefited greatly from the high degree of polish and control associated with walled gardens. Recently, closed Metaverses have come under scrutiny for not equitably rewarding players for time spent in-game, or even censoring certain groups. Notably, Open Metaverses do not have blanket immunity to similar issues.
