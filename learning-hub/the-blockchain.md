# What is the Blockchain?

A blockchain is a digitally distributed, decentralized, public ledger that lives on a network. Simply put, **the blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system**; blockchains are said to be tamper-proof.

**This public ledger is used to record transactions that take place across the network**. These transactions can include cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, or NFTs, like Digital Land.

Typically, blockchains reward users for contributing to the network; whether by running the computers (nodes) that keep the network up, evaluating the validity of network transactions (validators), or staking currency to help secure the network.

The tamper-proof and distributed nature of this ledger prevents the need for banks, brokers, or other intermediaries. Prominent blockchains include [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), and [Solana](https://solana.com)â€”each still fundamentally a public ledger, but with different rules of operation.
