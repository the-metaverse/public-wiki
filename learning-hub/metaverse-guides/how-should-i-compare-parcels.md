# How should I compare parcels?

There are many factors which might contribute to whether or not you decide to buy or sell a given parcel. Especially in such a nascent space, first time traders can be overwhelmed with options. This living article details some tools and techniques which can be applied to the land trading process in order to make informed decisions.&#x20;

### Metaverse Economies

As described in our [buying Land article](how-do-i-buy-land.md), understanding the economies of the Metaverse in which your Land will be located is critical to make good long-term investments.

To assist in learning about the economy of each Metaverse, we've created a dynamic, real-time [Metaverse Analytics Portal](https://analytics.wemeta.world).&#x20;

Here you can learn in real time about up & coming Metaverses by investigating the Land market cap, the daily volume, player counts, price per square meter and much more. For another 'at a glance' view, you can also visit our [Leaderboards](https://wemeta.world/leaderboards/lands) - which display the current top Metaverses, purchased Lands, Owners, and Communities.

### Metaverse Mechanics

Not all Metaverses are designed the same way, and as such, the value accrual mechanics for properties will vary from world to world. Our '[which Metaverse to play](which-metaverse-should-i-play.md)' article outlines some of the larger Metaverse mechanic categories. For Platform-style Metaverses, it can be important to purchase enough adjacent property to construct a large experience. For Game-style Metaverses, it can be important to assess the game mechanics that give Land its value - and optimize your purchase around maximizing those resources accordingly. For Gallery-style Metaverses, it could be important to place your gallery in close proximity to other famous galleries to maximize your foot traffic.&#x20;

Further, while not all Metaverses have a [finite amount of land](https://www.niftyisland.com), some Metaverses only have a few parcels of land that [haven't yet been exposed to the market](https://sandboxgame.gitbook.io/the-sandbox/land/buying-selling-and-renting-land/public-land-sales). Evaluating the land supply and demand (via the tools here on WeMeta) is another great avenue to assess the future value & rarity of your land purchase.&#x20;

### Location, Location, Location

Much like with the real world, the location of your digital Land can matter a lot. Metaverses have many points of interest - be they [teleporters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W48kWlN51Ao), [casinos](https://www.vegascity.org/about), [landmarks](https://play.decentraland.org/?position=-106%2C-119), or even [neighborhoods](https://fortune.com/2021/12/09/snoop-dogg-rapper-metaverse-snoopverse/). Metaverses also have hot area where players congregate or throw events. Understanding these dynamics - or building a parcel to influence them yourself is important to ensure your land accrues value effectively.&#x20;

Our We-Estimate takes into consideration all of these factors and more - giving you a number you can trust to assess the true value of your Land.
