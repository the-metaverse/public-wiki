# Which Metaverse should I play?

The quantity and variety of Metaverses is growing enormously month over month. With this growth, it can be overwhelming to filter through and find the right Metaverse for your needs. This article aims to disambiguate the different kinds of Metaverses, as well as provide associated resources for each one.

### Metaverse as a Platform

Certain Metaverses excel as platforms on which land owners and players can build. Sometimes these Metaverses offer only rudimentary geography - instead creating powerful game engines and building & terraforming tools for others to harness. These Metaverses are quite popular as they enable others to craft and shape their own digital visions.&#x20;
