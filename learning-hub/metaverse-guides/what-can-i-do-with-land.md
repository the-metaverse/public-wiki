# What can I do with Land?

Though the development of the Metaverse is still early, there are already some promising and compelling Land use cases for early buyers.&#x20;

### Host Events

Metaverse Events are one of the easiest ways to start attracting traffic to your parcel. Metaverse events can also vary in complexity without overtly detracting from attendance - we've well-attended events across both simple and extravagant parcel constructions. In the great words of Ray Kinsella... "If you build it, they will come". Platform-style Metaverses offer the most flexibility when it comes to hosting events - allowing for everything from a [simple gathering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMvu45P9EaE), to [festivals](https://themetaversefestival.io), to entire [sub-games or sub-Metaverses](http://www.thewonderquest.com/home).

### Build Experiences

Developing something interesting on your land - be it static or interactive, is another fantastic way to attract traffic. Many of the Platform-style Metaverses offer SDKs for Metaverse construction as well as integrations with popular modeling tools like [3DS Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max), [Blender](https://www.blender.org), or [AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/3d-modeling-software). Though many Metaverses have height restrictions when it comes to buildings, this ceiling typically scales up as the size of your Land plot increases (i.e. bigger plot of Land, higher max ceiling).

Sometimes, however, as a Land owner it can be difficult to obtain and maintain the skills needed to create compelling buildings & experiences in the Metaverse. This is where networking with existing builders can be extremely advantageous. While we will also be surfacing these builder integrations in our [Management Hub](https://www.wemeta.world/profile/properties), there are several building firms & aggregators whom we already work with and who we highly recommend for Metaverse architecture construction.

### Rent Your Land

Renting your Land is another fantastic way to start generating passive income off your assets. In fact, we're already seeing users construct flexible venues, auditoriums, and Metaverse clubs near highly trafficked areas for the purposes of renting. Many Metaverses also allow the rental owner to temporarily build on their leased property - allowing for further customization, and in some cases, allowing the owner of the Land to rent it without having to construct anything at all. As with the builder integrations, rent integrations will soon be available from our [Management Hub](https://www.wemeta.world/profile/properties). In the meantime, there are several renting platforms available for use right now.

### Create an Office

While many of the above suggestions have involved attracting other users to your Land, of course - you can design your Land such that you and your network are the primary users! We're seeing [many brands set up shop in the Metaverse](https://www.protocol.com/workplace/virtual-office-metaverse) - particularly on platforms like Decentraland. In fact, WeMeta itself has [a Real Estate Office in Somnium Space](https://office.wemeta.world). Building a digital presence in the Metaverse is a great way to attract more customers - and interact with your user base in a more global, decentralized way.
