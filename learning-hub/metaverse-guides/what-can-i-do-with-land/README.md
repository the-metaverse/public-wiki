# What can I do with Land?

Though the development of the Metaverse is still early, there are already some promising and compelling Land use cases for early buyers.&#x20;

### Events

Metaverse Events are one of the easiest ways to start attracting traffic to your parcel. Metaverse events can also vary in complexity without overtly detracting from attendance - we've well-attended events across both simple and extravagant parcel constructions. In the great words of Ray Kinsella... "If you build it, they will come". Platform-style Metaverses offer the most flexibility when it comes to hosting events - allowing for everything from a [simple gathering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMvu45P9EaE), to [festivals](https://themetaversefestival.io), to entire [sub-games or sub-Metaverses](http://www.thewonderquest.com/home).

### Building

Developing something interesting on your land - be it static or interactive, is another fantastic way to attract traffic. Many of the Platform-style Metaverses offer SDKs for Metaverse construction as well as integrations with popular modeling tools like 3DS Max, Blendr, or AutoCAD. Though many Metaverses have height restrictions when it comes to buildings, this ceiling typically scales up as the size of your Land plot increases (i.e. bigger plot of Land, higher max ceiling).
