# How do I buy Land?

Great news! You can buy Land [right here on WeMeta](https://wemeta.world). Before buying Land, however, it can be helpful to evaluate your needs not only from a product & land-use perspective, but also from an economic perspective - after all, much like in the real world, buying digital Land can also be a long-term investment.

### Making an Informed Decision

#### Metaverse Economies

To help you learn about the economy of each Metaverse, we've created a dynamic, real-time [Metaverse Analytics Portal](https://analytics.wemeta.world).&#x20;

By looking at the sales activity, user counts, volume, and market cap behavior each Metaverse you can start to paint a picture about which Metaverse is right for you. For another 'at a glance' view, you can also visit our [Leaderboards](https://wemeta.world/leaderboards/lands) - which display the current top Metaverses, purchased Lands, Owners, and Communities.

#### Metaverse Uses

After researching the economies of the Metaverse, we recommend you [visit our article](which-metaverse-should-i-play.md) [on which Metaverses to play](which-metaverse-should-i-play.md), to further learn about how the Metaverse in which you're buying Land operates. Different Metaverses offer different player and investor incentives. Some like [Sandbox ](https://www.sandbox.game/en/)serve as a platform on which to build other games and activities, while others like [League of Kingdoms](https://www.leagueofkingdoms.com) or [High Street](https://www.highstreet.market) have more pre-defined applications and uses.

You can also visit our [what to do with land articles](what-can-i-do-with-land.md) to learn more about how the land you intend to purchase can be used to generate revenue, create architecture, host events, and build communities.

#### Land Comparisons

Finally, it can be helpful to understand which factors drive the price of Land parcels, and how to compare them effectively. Check out our [article on comparing Land parcels](how-should-i-compare-parcels.md), or view our We-Estimate for your parcel to assess the demand for your Land.
